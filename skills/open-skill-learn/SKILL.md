description: Remembers what the user teaches - lessons, preferences, conventions, glossary terms and project facts - in their local knowledge so future work and routing use them; also forgets notes, exports them, and handles starter-knowledge updates after a release. Use when the user says "remember", "from now on", "note that", "always", "never again", "don't do X again", "forget", "ghi nhớ", "bài học", "từ giờ", when they correct how you worked, when an incident teaches something, or when they ask to export notes or review seed updates.

# Open Skill Learn

Current models do better work when they can read lessons from earlier sessions. This skill keeps those lessons as small local files that `open-skill route` attaches to future chains.

`open-skill` means the CLI; if it is not on PATH use `uvx --from git+https://github.com/VoKhoiNhon/open-skill-standard@v0.4.0 open-skill`.

## Save

One fact per note, written so it still makes sense months later. Record corrections and approaches the user confirmed, with the reason when it matters.

```bash
open-skill learn "<one fact>" --applies-to <scopes> --type lesson|preference|pitfall|glossary|project-fact
```

Scopes tell the router when the note applies; combine as needed, comma separated:
`skill:<id>` (for example `skill:bmad-method/bmad-build`), `role:<role-id>`, `project:<absolute path>`, `phase:<phase>`, or `role:*` for everything.

Saving the same text again updates the existing note instead of duplicating it. Don't save what the repository or chat history already records. The CLI refuses text that looks like a secret, token, email or phone number; keep credentials and personal data out of notes entirely.

## Forget, review, move

- `ls ~/.open-skill/knowledge/` lists notes; each is a plain Markdown file the user can edit.
- `open-skill forget <note-id>` deletes one; delete notes that turned out to be wrong.
- `open-skill export <file.zip>` copies profile and notes to another machine (usage history stays local).
- `open-skill scan --memory` imports Claude Code memory files as notes, read-only.

## After an update

Updating skills or the CLI never changes the notes folder. When the CLI reports that it upgraded the user's data, or `open-skill status` lists seed updates to review, tell the user in one line and offer:

- `open-skill upgrade --dry-run`, then `open-skill upgrade` — back up, migrate, sync starter knowledge.
- `open-skill seeds diff` — upstream rewrote a seed the user had edited; `seeds accept <id>` takes upstream's wording (after a backup), `seeds keep <id>` keeps theirs.
- `open-skill upgrade --rollback` — undo the last upgrade.

Let the user decide on seed updates; their edited wording is theirs.

## First use

If `~/.open-skill/profile.yaml` does not exist, suggest `open-skill init --role <role>[=weight]`; it saves the user's roles and seeds starter notes for them.
